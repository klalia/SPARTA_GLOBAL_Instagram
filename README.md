# SPARTA_GLOBAL_Instagram

This is an Instagram page created through the use of HTML and CSS. It is based more on the structure and layout rather than the functionality, to portray my HTML and CSS skills gained. It has been completed through the use of CSS Flexbox layout.

Flexbox made it easier to design a flexible responsive layout structure without the use of float. Features like justify-content and align-items for the alignment of items on the page and flex-direction to define the direction were used as apart of the CSS Flexbox layout. 

Hypertext Markup Language(HTML) is the language that focuses on the structure of a webpage and Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) is the language used to describe how HTML elements are displayed on a webpage, focusing more on the design and layout. The CSS page has been linked through inline stylesheet tags in the head of the html page. This Instagram page has come together purely through the use of these two languages.
